Placeholdit Image Widgets

== Description ==

Quickly create image widgets using the http://placehold.it service. Widgets can have customized image dimensions, background, text color and label. Multiple widgets supported. http://placekitten.com also supported!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `placeholdit.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the "Placeholdit Widget" to any sidebar or widget area and customize

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add customization options = 

Not at this time. Currently the plugin provides access to most of the placehold.it features (except file type). If features are added to placehold.it I will try to implement them here as quickly as possible.

= Can I change the font = 

Alas, no. I wish you could but no.

= What's the Deal with Placekittens.com? =

Thanks to Toby Cyns over at <a href="http://themightymo.com">TheMightyMo.com</a> for the tip. If you feel like placehold.it images are just a bit dull or your site absolutely needs kittens just check the "Use placekittens.com instead" checkbox. Not that only width and height work with placekittens.
